        Belize , with a population of approximately 380,000 inhabitants, is
        located on the northern Caribbean coast of Central America. Its capital
        is the city of Belmopan and the most populated city is Belize City . The
        encounter between the Caribbean Indians and the Africans who were
        brought to Belize as slaves by the European colonizers, gave rise to a
        new ethnic group: the Garifuna . Belize was part of the Mayan Empire
        that stretched from southern Mexico to Guatemala and Honduras. Later it
        was explored by the Spanish and later colonized by the British Empire
        until its full independence in 1981. Belize is part of the important
        Mesoamerican biological corridor, with great biological diversity, both
        marine and terrestrial. The Caribbean coast is lined with coral reefs
        and some 450 islets and islands known locally as ' cayes '. Three of the
        four coral reefs in the western hemisphere are located off the coast of
        Belize . It is the only country in Central America where the official
        language is English , being a former British colony, although Spanish,
        Belizean Creole, and to a lesser extent, Mayan, Arawak and Garifuna are
        also spoken. Bilingualism is very common and encouraged. The majority of
        the population professes Catholicism, and British influence has brought
        a considerable and varied Protestant congregation, including German and
        Swiss Mennonites.

      <p>
        Located in the northwestern corner of Central America, the Republic of
        Guatemala has an approximate population of 15,700,000 inhabitants, and a
        wide indigenous culture, product of the Mayan heritage and Spanish
        influence during the colonial period. Its capital is Guatemala City ,
        officially called "Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción". Despite its
        relatively small territorial extension, Guatemala has a great climatic
        variety, product of its mountainous relief , reaching a height of up to
        4,220 meters above sea level. The official language is Spanish ,
        although it is used as a second language by some ethnic groups in other
        parts of the country. There are alsoTwenty-one Mayan languages , in
        addition to the Xinca and Garifuna languages, the latter spoken by the
        Afro-descendant population in the Caribbean department of Izabal. The
        current Guatemalan culture is the result of the numerous Mayan, Spanish,
        Afro-Caribbean, Mexican and to a lesser extent American influences , as
        well as the rest of America. The influence of the natives and the
        Spanish colonists can still be seen throughout Guatemala. "Typical"
        fabrics and some traditional clothing are made in a traditional Mayan
        way, however, cross-culturalization has had an influence on clothing,
        mainly in the young indigenous population. Important archaeological
        sites with Mayan ruins can also be found .
