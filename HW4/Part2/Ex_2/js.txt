-Unobtrusive JavaScript
Is a best practice methodology for attaching JavaScript to the front-end of a website. 
It’s an ideal to strive toward and something we should bear in mind whenever we’re adding JavaScript to a site.

It is the separation of behaviour from markup or structure. 
Just like the CSS gurus of old taught us there should be a separation of layout from markup, there should be a separation of behaviour from markup. 
That’s HTML for the content and structure of the document, CSS for the layout and style, and Unobtrusive JavaScript for behaviour and interactivity.



Example: 
<input type="button" id="btn" onclick="alert('Test')" />
That is not unobstrusive javascript because behaviour and presentation are mixed. The onclick shouldn't be there in html and should be part of javascript itself not html.

With above example, you can go unobstrusive like this:
<input type="button" id="btn" />

JavaScript:
var el = document.getElementById('btn');
el.onclick = function(){
  alert('Test');
};

-What is Null and Undefined in JavaScript
Null and Undefined are both data types in JavaScript.
Undefined is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null as an assignment value. So you can assign the value null to any variable which basically means it’s blank.
